#CIFAR-10 Dataset Image Classificaition Using a CNN#

This project was my final for my statistical learning class. For this project I had to create a convolutional neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 Dataset. 
The dataset can be found [HERE](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
After training the neural network I had to create an autoencoder and reconstruct the images. I compared the output of both and plotted the accuracy of the different models. 
See the PDF report for an overview of the project.
